            <h1>David Sedaris Book Cover Design</h1>
            <h3>Print</h3>
            <h4>School Project | Intro to Graphic Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>David Sedaris is an American humorist, comedian, author, and radio contributor. We picked three short stories from his books and based on his story, and we created book cover as one big book. The goal of this project was to create a design that can show the book summary only on the front of the book. For that, we had to understand the book thoroughly. Also, even the idea is good, and they need to show appropriately. Those parts were the hard things.</li>

                <li>The first book, "It's Catching" is about the parasite. People in the story were rejecting parasite because it is gross and they don't know what the parasites are doing inside of their body, and people were guessing what it is doing. One person said the parasite might be controlling people's body, and I thought that means the person's body is parasite's. This thinking process turned out to that design.</li>

                <li>The second book, "Town and Country" is about any people who talk nasty topics and use bad words. David Sedaris was visiting his sister, and on the way, he hears or make a conversation with a wealthy old couple, poor looking taxi driver, and his sister. Each one of them talks about something sexual and using bad words. The Design is a fancy, productive, and elegant looking hand is sticking the middle finger to represent those people.</li>

                <li>The third book, "Crybaby" is about David Sedaris' funny personality and a crying guy who sat next to him. The guy lost his mother and was in the plane on the way to her funeral. However, David Sedaris was making funny mistakes and laughing from watching a comedy show next to him. The book cover design is melted ice cream with ice cream tear. The ice cream is from what David Sedaris ate in the plane, also represents his happiness and hilariousness.</li>
